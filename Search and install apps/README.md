This PowerShell script creates a tool called "sia" (Software Installation & Updates Checker) that works with both winget and chocolatey package managers. Here's what it can do:
Features:

Install software: sia install firefox
Update software: sia update chrome or update all with sia update
Search for packages: sia search vscode
List installed packages: sia list
Uninstall packages: sia uninstall firefox
Configure preferred package manager: sia config pm=winget or sia config pm=choco

How it works:

Uses winget by default but can be switched to chocolatey
Automatically detects if your preferred package manager is installed
Offers to switch to the alternative if your preferred one isn't available
Saves your configuration preferences in a file

Usage:
Save the script as sia.ps1 in a directory on your PATH, then you can call it like:
powershell

```
.\InstallApps.ps1 install firefox
```
